    """
    Function to compute the counts-in-cells on points on the sky. Suitable
    for mock catalogs and observed galaxies.
    
    Returns a numpy structured array containing the probability of a
    sphere of radius up to ``rmax`` containing [0, num_pN-1] galaxies.

    Parameters
    -----------
    
    rmax: double
       Maximum radius of the sphere to place on the particles
    
    nbins: integer
       Number of bins in the counts-in-cells. Radius of first shell
       is rmax/nbins
    
    nspheres: integer (>= 0)
       Number of random spheres to place within the particle distribution.
       For a small number of spheres, the error is larger in the measured
       pN's.
    
    num_pN: integer (>= 1)
       Governs how many unique pN's are to returned. If ``num_pN` is set to 1,
       then only the vpf (p0) is returned. For `num_pN=2`, p0 and p1 are
       returned.

       More explicitly, the columns in the results look like the following:
         num_pN = 1 -> p0
         num_pN = 2 -> p0 p1
         num_pN = 3 -> p0 p1 p2
         and so on...(note that p0 is the vpf).

    threshold_ngb: integer
       Minimum number of random points needed in a ``rmax`` sphere such that it
       is considered to be entirely within the mock footprint. The
       command-line version, ``xi_mocks/vpf/vpf_mocks.c``, assumes that the
       minimum number of randoms can be at most a 1-sigma deviation from
       the expected random number density.

    centers_file: string, filename
       A file containing random sphere centers. If the file does not exist,
       then a list of random centers will be written out. In that case, the
       randoms arrays, ``RAND_RA``, ``RAND_DEC`` and ``RAND_CZ`` are used to
       check that the sphere is entirely within the footprint. If the file does
       exist but either ``rmax`` is too small or there are not enough centers
       then the file will be overwritten.

       Note: If the centers file has to be written, the code will take
       significantly longer to finish. However, subsequent runs can re-use
       that centers file and will be faster.

    cosmology: integer, required
        Integer choice for setting cosmology. Valid values are 1->LasDamas
        cosmology and 2->Planck cosmology. If you need arbitrary cosmology,
        easiest way is to convert the ``CZ`` values into co-moving distance,
        based on your preferred cosmology. Set ``is_comoving_dist=True``, to
        indicate that the co-moving distance conversion has already been done.
    
        Choices: 1 -> LasDamas cosmology. Om=0.25,  Ol=0.75
                 2 -> Planck   cosmology. Om=0.302, Ol=0.698
     
        To setup a new cosmology, add an entry to the function,
        ``init_cosmology`` in ``ROOT/utils/cosmology_params.c` and re-install
        the entire package.

    RA: array-like, real (float/double)
        The array of Right Ascensions for the first set of points. RA's
        are expected to be in [0.0, 360.0], but the code will try to fix cases
        where the RA's are in [-180, 180.0]. For peace of mind, always supply
        RA's in [0.0, 360.0].

        Calculations are done in the precision of the supplied arrays.

    DEC: array-like, real (float/double)
         Array of Declinations for the first set of points. DEC's are expected
         to be in the [-90.0, 90.0], but the code will try to fix cases where
         the DEC's are in [0.0, 180.0]. Again, for peace of mind, always supply
         DEC's in [-90.0, 90.0].

         Must be of same precision type as RA.

    CZ: array-like, real (float/double)
         Array of (Speed Of Light * Redshift) values for the first set of
         points. Code will try to detect cases where ``redshifts`` have been
         passed and multiply the entire array with the ``speed of light``.

         * If is_comoving_dist is set, then ``CZ`` is interpreted as the
         co-moving distance, rather than (Speed Of Light * Redshift).


    RAND_RA: array-like, real (float/double)
        The array of Right Ascensions for the randoms. RA's are expected to be
        in [0.0, 360.0], but the code will try to fix cases where the RA's are
        in [-180, 180.0]. For peace of mind, always supply RA's in
        [0.0, 360.0].

        Must be of same precision type as RA/DEC/CZ.

    RAND_DEC: array-like, real (float/double)
         Array of Declinations for the randoms. DEC's are expected to be in the
         [-90.0, 90.0], but the code will try to fix cases where the DEC's are
         in [0.0, 180.0]. Again, for peace of mind, always supply DEC's in
         [-90.0, 90.0].

         Must be of same precision type as RA/DEC/CZ.

    RAND_CZ: array-like, real (float/double)
         Array of (Speed Of Light * Redshift) values for the randoms. Code
         will try to detect cases where ``redshifts`` have been
         passed and multiply the entire array with the ``speed of light``.

         * If is_comoving_dist is set, then ``CZ2`` is interpreted as the
         co-moving distance, rather than `(Speed Of Light * Redshift)`.

    NOTE: RAND_RA, RAND_DEC and RAND_CZ are only used when the ``centers_file``
          needs to be written out. In that case, the RAND_RA, RAND_DEC, and
          RAND_CZ are used as random centers.

    verbose: boolean (default false)
       Boolean flag to control output of informational messages
    
    is_comoving_dist: boolean (default false)
         Boolean flag to indicate that ``cz`` values have already been
         converted into co-moving distances. This flag allows arbitrary
         cosmologies to be used in ``Corrfunc``.

    c_api_timer: boolean (default false)
       Boolean flag to measure actual time spent in the C libraries. Here
       to allow for benchmarking and scaling studies.

    isa: string (default ``fastest``)
       Controls the runtime dispatch for the instruction set to use. Possible
       options are: [``fastest``, ``avx``, ``sse42``, ``fallback``]
    
       Setting isa to ``fastest`` will pick the fastest available instruction
       set on the current computer. However, if you set ``isa`` to, say,
       ``avx`` and ``avx`` is not available on the computer, then the code will
       revert to using ``fallback`` (even though ``sse42`` might be available).
       
       Unless you are benchmarking the different instruction sets, you should
       always leave ``isa`` to the default value. And if you *are*
       benchmarking, then the string supplied here gets translated into an
       ``enum`` for the instruction set defined in ``utils/defs.h``.
       
    Returns
    --------

    results: Numpy structured array

       A numpy structured array containing [rmax, pN[num_pN]] with ``nbins``
       elements. Each row contains the maximum radius of the sphere and the
       ``num_pN`` elements in the ``pN`` array. Each element of this array
       contains the probability that a sphere of radius ``rmax`` contains
       *exactly* ``N`` galaxies. For example, pN[0] (p0, the void probibility
       function) is the probability that a sphere of radius ``rmax`` contains 0
       galaxies.

       if ``c_api_timer`` is set, then the return value is a tuple containing
       (results, api_time). ``api_time`` measures only the time spent within
       the C library and ignores all python overhead.

    """
    Calculate the 2-D pair-counts corresponding to the projected correlation
    function, :math:`\\xi(r_p, \pi)`. Pairs which are separated by less
    than the ``rp`` bins (specified in ``binfile``) in the
    X-Y plane, and less than ``pimax`` in the Z-dimension are
    counted. The input positions are expected to be on-sky co-ordinates.
    This module is suitable for calculating correlation functions for mock
    catalogs.


    Returns a numpy structured array containing the pair counts for the
    specified bins.

    Note, that this module only returns pair counts and not the actual
    correlation function :math:`\\xi(r_p, \pi)`. See the
    ``xi_mocks/DDrppi/wprp_mocks.c`` for computing :math:`wp(r_p)` from
    the pair counts returned.
     
    Parameters
    -----------

    autocorr: boolean, required
        Boolean flag for auto/cross-correlation. If autocorr is set to 1,
        then the second set of particle positions are not required.

    cosmology: integer, required
        Integer choice for setting cosmology. Valid values are 1->LasDamas
        cosmology and 2->Planck cosmology. If you need arbitrary cosmology,
        easiest way is to convert the ``CZ`` values into co-moving distance,
        based on your preferred cosmology. Set ``is_comoving_dist=True``, to
        indicate that the co-moving distance conversion has already been done.
    
        Choices: 1 -> LasDamas cosmology. Om=0.25,  Ol=0.75
                 2 -> Planck   cosmology. Om=0.302, Ol=0.698
     
        To setup a new cosmology, add an entry to the function,
        ``init_cosmology`` in ``ROOT/utils/cosmology_params.c`` and re-install
        the entire package.

    nthreads: integer
        The number of OpenMP threads to use. Has no effect if OpenMP was not
        enabled during library compilation.

    pimax: double
        A double-precision value for the maximum separation along
        the Z-dimension. Note that only pairs with ``0 <= dz < pimax``
        are counted (no equality).

        Distances along the :math:`\\pi` direction are binned with unit
        depth. For instance, if ``pimax=40``, then 40 bins will be created
        along the ``pi`` direction.

    binfile: string or an list/array of floats
       For string input: filename specifying the ``rp`` bins for
       ``DDrppi_mocks``. The file should contain white-space separated values
       of (rpmin, rpmax)  for each ``rp`` wanted. The bins do not need to be
       contiguous but must be in increasing order (smallest bins come first).

       For array-like input: A sequence of ``rp`` values that provides the
       bin-edges. For example,
       ``np.logspace(np.log10(0.1), np.log10(10.0), 15)`` is a valid
       input, specifying 15 (logarithmic) bins between 0.1 and 10.0. This
       array does not need to be sorted.

    RA1: array-like, real (float/double)
        The array of Right Ascensions for the first set of points. RA's
        are expected to be in [0.0, 360.0], but the code will try to fix cases
        where the RA's are in [-180, 180.0]. For peace of mind, always supply
        RA's in [0.0, 360.0].

        Calculations are done in the precision of the supplied arrays.

    DEC1: array-like, real (float/double)
         Array of Declinations for the first set of points. DEC's are expected
         to be in the [-90.0, 90.0], but the code will try to fix cases where
         the DEC's are in [0.0, 180.0]. Again, for peace of mind, always supply
         DEC's in [-90.0, 90.0].

         Must be of same precision type as RA1.

    CZ1: array-like, real (float/double)
         Array of (Speed Of Light * Redshift) values for the first set of
         points. Code will try to detect cases where ``redshifts`` have been
         passed and multiply the entire array with the ``speed of light``.

         * If is_comoving_dist is set, then ``CZ1`` is interpreted as the
         co-moving distance, rather than `cz`.

    RA2: array-like, real (float/double)
        The array of Right Ascensions for the second set of points. RA's
        are expected to be in [0.0, 360.0], but the code will try to fix cases
        where the RA's are in [-180, 180.0]. For peace of mind, always supply
        RA's in [0.0, 360.0].

        Must be of same precision type as RA1/DEC1/CZ1.

    DEC2: array-like, real (float/double)
         Array of Declinations for the second set of points. DEC's are expected
         to be in the [-90.0, 90.0], but the code will try to fix cases where
         the DEC's are in [0.0, 180.0]. Again, for peace of mind, always supply
         DEC's in [-90.0, 90.0].

         Must be of same precision type as RA1/DEC1/CZ1.

    CZ2: array-like, real (float/double)
         Array of (Speed Of Light * Redshift) values for the second set of
         points. Code will try to detect cases where ``redshifts`` have been
         passed and multiply the entire array with the ``speed of light``.

         * If is_comoving_dist is set, then ``CZ2`` is interpreted as the
         co-moving distance, rather than `cz`.
        
         Must be of same precision type as RA1/DEC1/CZ1.

    is_comoving_dist: boolean (default false)
         Boolean flag to indicate that ``cz`` values have already been
         converted into co-moving distances. This flag allows arbitrary
         cosmologies to be used in ``Corrfunc``.

    verbose: boolean (default false)
       Boolean flag to control output of informational messages

    output_rpavg: boolean (default false)
       Boolean flag to output the average ``rp`` for each bin. Code will
       run slower if you set this flag. Also, note, if you are calculating
       in single-precision, ``rpavg`` will suffer from numerical loss of
       precision and can not be trusted. If you need accurate ``rpavg``
       values, then pass in double precision arrays for the particle positions.

    fast_divide: boolean (default false)
       Boolean flag to replace the division in ``AVX`` implementation with an
       approximate reciprocal, followed by a Newton-Raphson step. Improves
       runtime by ~15-20%. Loss of precision is at the 5-6th decimal place.

    c_api_timer: boolean (default false)
       Boolean flag to measure actual time spent in the C libraries. Here
       to allow for benchmarking and scaling studies.

    isa: string (default ``fastest``)
       Controls the runtime dispatch for the instruction set to use. Possible
       options are: [``fastest``, ``avx``, ``sse42``, ``fallback``]
    
       Setting isa to ``fastest`` will pick the fastest available instruction
       set on the current computer. However, if you set ``isa`` to, say,
       ``avx`` and ``avx`` is not available on the computer, then the code will
       revert to using ``fallback`` (even though ``sse42`` might be available).
       
       Unless you are benchmarking the different instruction sets, you should
       always leave ``isa`` to the default value. And if you *are*
       benchmarking, then the string supplied here gets translated into an
       ``enum`` for the instruction set defined in ``utils/defs.h``.
       
    Returns
    --------

    results: Numpy structured array

       A numpy structured array containing [rmin, rmax, ravg, pimax, npairs]
       for each radial bin specified in the ``binfile``. If ``output_ravg`` is
       not set, then ``ravg`` will be set to 0.0 for all bins. ``npairs``
       contains the number of pairs in that bin and can be used to compute the
       actual :math:`\\xi(r_p, \pi)` or :math:`\\wp(r_p)` by combining with
       (DR, RR) counts.

       if ``c_api_timer`` is set, then the return value is a tuple containing
       (results, api_time). ``api_time`` measures only the time spent within
       the C library and ignores all python overhead.
